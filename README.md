Team Name : The Gamer.

Brief Description : The main difficulty was that we need to make the app with kotlin (which was also covered in its session). (A relatively newer language to me also).
So it is a tic-tac-toe game kotlin app and have multiplayer 2 player mod and single player computer mode. 

I want to continue improving it further, and fix few bugs.
